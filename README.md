# Céu-Maker: Select device

Intended to be used together with [Céu-Maker](https://github.com/ceu-lang/ceu-maker), `SelectDevice` is an application that lists the connected Arduino boards and allows the user to select one.

In Céu-Maker, all Céu-Arduino applications should contain a `board.conf` file, which defines for which Arduino board and port the application should be uploaded to. It stores 4 settings, separated by a blank space:
- ARD_BOARD
- ARD_PORT
- ARD_CPU
- ARD_MCU

If this file doesn't exists, the `Céu-Arduino.exe` run `SelectDevice` so the user select a connected board. This process generates a `board.conf` file in the application's folder. The following uploads will not ask for board selection, since the file already exists. If you want to change the upload configurations without change the `board.conf` manually, drag and drop your application's folder or file to `SelectDevice.exe`.

There is also possible to define a global configuration, so all uploads uses it in case no `board.conf` is provided with the application.

## Dev notes
This app was developed using Visual Studio Community 2017 and only supports devices from package "arduino" and arch "avr".

### Inspiration 
The Arduino IDE uses the file *hardware\arduino\avr\boards.txt* to identify ports and boards. With a VID/PID combination we can identify the USB device that is plugged and then search in this file for more information, such as the name of the board.


### Create a new release version
To create a new release version, make sure to move the exe generated by the Visual Studio from *SelectDevices/bin/Release/* to *ceu-maker/ceu-maker-windows/bin*

### #if DEBUG
In the [*SelectDevice/Form1.cs*](https://github.com/AnnyCaroline/ceu-maker-gsoc/blob/master/SelectDevice/SelectDevice/Form1.cs), we can find blocks of code using ```#if DEBUG```:

```
#if DEBUG
    string text = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(@"absolute-path-to\arduino-1.8.3\hardware\arduino\avr\boards.txt");
#else
    string text = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(@"..\arduino-1.8.3\hardware\arduino\avr\boards.txt");
#endif
```
The above code was included to facilitate the location of *boards.txt* file in develop stage. If you're compiling a debug version o SelectDevice, you can use the absolute path of ```boards.txt```changing the string in the second line. For release, use a relative path.
